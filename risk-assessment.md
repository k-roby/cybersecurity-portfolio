# Risk Assessment – Botium Toys

## Scope and Goals of the Audit

**Scope:**  
The scope of this audit is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This includes employee devices, internal networks, company systems, and associated assets. The assessment reviews Botium Toys’ asset inventory, controls, and compliance posture.

**Goals:**  
Assess existing assets  
Complete a controls and compliance checklist  
Determine which best practices must be implemented  
Improve and harden Botium Toys’ overall security posture

## Current Assets

Assets managed by the IT department include:

- On-premises equipment for in-office operations  
- Employee devices: desktops, laptops, smartphones, remote stations, headsets, keyboards, etc.  
- Storefront inventory (on-site and online), stored in the adjoining warehouse  
- Systems and services (accounting, telecom, database, security, ecommerce, inventory management)  
- Internet access  
- Internal network  
- Data storage and retention  
- Legacy system maintenance requiring human oversight and compensating controls

## Risk Assessment

**Risk description:**  
Botium Toys lacks proper asset management and has not implemented all necessary controls. They are also not fully compliant with U.S. or international data protection standards.

**Control best practices:**  
According to the Identify function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Botium Toys should dedicate resources to identifying all assets, classifying them, and determining the potential business impact if those assets are compromised.

**Risk score:**  
**8/10 – High**, due to the absence of controls and the lack of regulatory compliance.

## Comments

While the potential impact of data loss is medium, the likelihood and regulatory consequences are high due to the following:

- All employees have access to internal customer data, including PII/SPII  
- Credit card data is not encrypted  
- Access controls like least privilege and separation of duties are not implemented  
- Availability and data integrity controls are in place  
- Firewall is in place with custom rules configured  
- Antivirus software is installed and monitored  
- There is no IDS (Intrusion Detection System)  
- There is no disaster recovery plan or data backups  
- There is a breach notification policy in place for the E.U.  
- Privacy policies and documentation processes are enforced  
- Password policy is weak and not aligned with modern standards  
- There is no centralized password management system  
- Legacy systems have not been updated, maintained, or assigned a response plan  
- Physical store and warehouse are protected with locks, CCTV, and fire safety

## Summary

This risk assessment of Botium Toys’ systems was performed to assess asset controls and regulatory compliance. Although this was a simulated scenario for hands-on practice as part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, it demonstrates an understanding of the risk assessment process and frameworks like NIST CSF.

By identifying and evaluating assets and controls, the assessment revealed a lack of control implementation, weak password and access control policies, and a need for better asset classification and protection. These are essential actions for achieving compliance and protecting sensitive data.
